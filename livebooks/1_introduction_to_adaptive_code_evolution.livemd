# Introduction to Adaptive Code Evolution

## Overview

Adaptive Code Evolution is a pattern that enables software systems to continuously evolve and improve based on usage patterns, performance metrics, and feedback loops. This pattern represents a paradigm shift from static codebases to dynamic, self-improving systems.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:ash_swarm, path: "../"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.12.0"}
])
```

## Core Concepts

Adaptive Code Evolution comprises several fundamental concepts:

### 1. Code Analysis

Systems that implement adaptive code evolution must be able to analyze their own structure, identify potential optimization opportunities, and determine areas that could benefit from improvement.

```elixir
# Example of using the AICodeAnalysis module to analyze code
code_to_analyze = """
defmodule SlowOperations do
  def fibonacci(0), do: 0
  def fibonacci(1), do: 1
  def fibonacci(n) when n > 1, do: fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
end
"""

# This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes
analysis_result = %{
  opportunities: [
    %{
      target: "fibonacci/1",
      issue: "Exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations",
      severity: "high",
      optimization_potential: "high",
      suggested_approach: "Implement memoization to avoid redundant calculations"
    }
  ]
}

Kino.DataTable.new([analysis_result.opportunities])
```

### 2. Adaptation Strategies

Once optimization opportunities are identified, the system must determine how to adapt the code to improve it. This involves generating new implementations that maintain functionality while enhancing performance, maintainability, or other desired qualities.

````elixir
# Example of using AIAdaptationStrategies to generate optimized code
optimized_code = """
defmodule OptimizedOperations do
  def fibonacci(n), do: fibonacci_with_cache(n, %{0 => 0, 1 => 1})

  defp fibonacci_with_cache(n, cache) do
    case Map.get(cache, n) do
      nil ->
        {result, new_cache} = compute_fibonacci(n, cache)
        {result, new_cache}
      cached_value ->
        {cached_value, cache}
    end
  end

  defp compute_fibonacci(n, cache) do
    {n1, cache1} = fibonacci_with_cache(n - 1, cache)
    {n2, cache2} = fibonacci_with_cache(n - 2, cache1)
    result = n1 + n2
    {result, Map.put(cache2, n, result)}
  end
end
"""

Kino.Markdown.new("```elixir\n#{optimized_code}\n```")
````

### 3. Experiment Evaluation

Adaptive systems need to evaluate the effectiveness of code adaptations through experiments that compare the original and modified implementations across various metrics.

```elixir
evaluation_metrics = %{
  performance: [
    %{name: "execution_time", original: "2.5s", optimized: "0.01s", improvement: "99.6%"},
    %{name: "memory_usage", original: "150MB", optimized: "15MB", improvement: "90%"}
  ],
  maintainability: [
    %{name: "complexity", original: "high", optimized: "medium", improvement: "moderate"},
    %{name: "readability", original: "medium", optimized: "high", improvement: "significant"}
  ],
  safety: [
    %{name: "edge_cases", original: "vulnerable", optimized: "robust", improvement: "significant"},
    %{name: "error_handling", original: "minimal", optimized: "comprehensive", improvement: "significant"}
  ]
}

Kino.DataTable.new(evaluation_metrics.performance)
```

### 4. Continuous Learning Loop

The adaptive code evolution pattern establishes a continuous feedback loop that learns from previous adaptations, refines strategies over time, and builds a knowledge base of effective optimization patterns.

## Benefits of Adaptive Code Evolution

1. **Continuous Performance Improvement**: Systems automatically identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
2. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Regular adaptations prevent the accumulation of legacy code issues.
3. **Knowledge Capture**: Successful adaptations contribute to an organizational knowledge base.
4. **Responsive Evolution**: Systems can adapt to changing usage patterns and requirements.

## Integration with AI

Adaptive Code Evolution becomes particularly powerful when combined with AI:

1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: LLMs can analyze code structure and identify optimization opportunities.
2. **AI-Generated Adaptations**: LLMs can generate optimized implementations based on identified opportunities.
3. **AI-Evaluated Experiments**: LLMs can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of adaptations.

## Available Scripts

AshSwarm provides two scripts to demonstrate and test the Adaptive Code Evolution feature:

### Demo Script

The [`demo_adaptive_code_evolution.exs`](../demo_adaptive_code_evolution.exs) script demonstrates a simple example of the Adaptive Code Evolution system. It:

1. Takes an original slow implementation of Fibonacci and prime number functions
2. Analyzes the code to identify optimization opportunities
3. Generates an optimized version using memoization
4. Evaluates the optimization results

Running the demo shows the complete cycle of analysis, optimization, and evaluation.

### Stress Test Script

The [`stress_test_adaptive_code_evolution.exs`](../stress_test_adaptive_code_evolution.exs) script provides a comprehensive stress test that:

1. Tests 5 different module types with varying complexity
2. Implements intelligent retry logic for handling API rate limits
3. Provides detailed metrics and success ratings for each module
4. Generates a comprehensive summary of test results

The stress test is designed to evaluate the robustness of the system under load and verify its ability to handle rate limiting and other potential issues.

Both scripts require a valid Groq API key to function:

```bash
# To run the demo
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here mix run demo_adaptive_code_evolution.exs

# To run the stress test
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here mix run stress_test_adaptive_code_evolution.exs
```

## Next Steps

In the next livebook, we'll explore how to implement Adaptive Code Evolution in Elixir using the AshSwarm framework.
