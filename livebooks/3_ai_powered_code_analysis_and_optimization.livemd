# AI-Powered Code Analysis and Optimization

## Setup

This livebook explores how AI is used to analyze and optimize code in the Adaptive Code Evolution pattern.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:ash_swarm, path: "../"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.12.0"}
])

alias AshSwarm.Foundations.AICodeAnalysis
alias AshSwarm.Foundations.AIAdaptationStrategies
alias AshSwarm.Foundations.AIExperimentEvaluation
alias AshSwarm.InstructorHelper
```

## AI in Code Analysis

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding, analyzing, and generating code. In the context of Adaptive Code Evolution, AI plays several critical roles:

### 1. Static Code Analysis

LLMs can examine code structure, identify anti-patterns, detect potential bugs, and suggest improvements by leveraging their understanding of programming languages and best practices.

```elixir
# Sample code to analyze
code = """
defmodule SlowCryptography do
  def encrypt(text, key) do
    # Inefficient implementation - creates many intermediate lists
    text
    |> String.to_charlist()
    |> Enum.map(fn char -> 
      char + key 
    end)
    |> Enum.map(fn char -> 
      rem(char, 255) 
    end)
    |> List.to_string()
  end
  
  def decrypt(text, key) do
    # Duplicated logic with slight variation
    text
    |> String.to_charlist()
    |> Enum.map(fn char -> 
      char - key 
    end)
    |> Enum.map(fn char -> 
      rem(char + 255, 255) 
    end)
    |> List.to_string()
  end
end
"""

# Example analysis that would be produced by AI
analysis = %{
  issues: [
    %{
      type: "performance",
      location: "encrypt/2",
      description: "Multiple sequential Enum.map operations create unnecessary intermediate lists",
      suggestion: "Combine operations into a single Enum.map or use Enum.reduce"
    },
    %{
      type: "duplication",
      location: "encrypt/2 and decrypt/2",
      description: "Significant code duplication between these two functions",
      suggestion: "Extract common functionality into a helper function"
    },
    %{
      type: "algorithm",
      location: "encrypt/2 and decrypt/2",
      description: "Simple character substitution encryption is not secure",
      suggestion: "Consider using a standard encryption library like :crypto"
    }
  ]
}

Kino.DataTable.new(analysis.issues)
```

### 2. Contextual Understanding

Unlike traditional static analysis tools, LLMs can understand code in contextâ€”considering function purposes, variable naming conventions, and relationships between components.

```elixir
# Contextual understanding example
contextual_analysis = %{
  module_purpose: "Simple character-based encryption (not for production use)",
  function_roles: %{
    "encrypt/2": "Transforms plaintext by shifting character codes",
    "decrypt/2": "Reverses the encryption process"
  },
  improvement_areas: [
    "Code organization: Extract shared functionality",
    "Performance: Combine transformations to reduce intermediary lists",
    "Security: Replace with proper cryptographic algorithms if used in production",
    "Documentation: Add warnings about security limitations"
  ],
  identified_conventions: [
    "Function names clearly indicate purpose",
    "Simple parameter naming"
  ]
}

Kino.Markdown.new("""
**Module Purpose**: #{contextual_analysis.module_purpose}

**Function Roles**:
- encrypt/2: #{contextual_analysis.function_roles["encrypt/2"]}
- decrypt/2: #{contextual_analysis.function_roles["decrypt/2"]}

**Improvement Areas**:
#{Enum.map(contextual_analysis.improvement_areas, fn area -> "- #{area}" end) |> Enum.join("\\n")}
""")
```

## AI in Code Optimization

Once analysis is complete, AI can generate optimized implementations that address identified issues while maintaining the original functionality.

### 1. Optimization Generation

AI can generate multiple optimization strategies, each with different tradeoffs between performance, readability, and maintainability.

```elixir
# Optimized version that would be generated by AI
optimized_code = """
defmodule OptimizedCryptography do
  @moduledoc \"\"\"
  Provides simple character substitution encryption functions.
  
  Warning: This implementation is for educational purposes only and is not
  cryptographically secure. Do not use for sensitive data.
  \"\"\"
  
  @doc \"\"\"
  Encrypts text using a simple character substitution cipher.
  
  ## Parameters
  
    * `text` - The plaintext to encrypt
    * `key` - The encryption key (a number)
    
  ## Examples
  
      iex> OptimizedCryptography.encrypt("hello", 5)
      "mjqqt"
  \"\"\"
  def encrypt(text, key), do: transform_text(text, &(&1 + key))
  
  @doc \"\"\"
  Decrypts text that was encrypted using the same key.
  
  ## Parameters
  
    * `text` - The encrypted text
    * `key` - The encryption key (same as used for encryption)
    
  ## Examples
  
      iex> OptimizedCryptography.decrypt("mjqqt", 5)
      "hello"
  \"\"\"
  def decrypt(text, key), do: transform_text(text, &(&1 - key))
  
  # Private helper function to handle the character transformation
  defp transform_text(text, transform_fn) do
    text
    |> String.to_charlist()
    |> Enum.map(fn char -> 
      char
      |> transform_fn.()
      |> rem(255)
      |> normalize_char()
    end)
    |> List.to_string()
  end
  
  # Ensure character value stays within the valid range
  defp normalize_char(char) when char < 0, do: char + 255
  defp normalize_char(char), do: char
end
"""

Kino.Markdown.new("```elixir\n#{optimized_code}\n```")
```

### 2. Optimization Rationale

AI can provide detailed explanations of the optimizations performed and their expected impacts:

```elixir
optimization_rationale = %{
  refactorings: [
    %{
      type: "Extract method",
      description: "Created transform_text/2 helper function to eliminate code duplication",
      benefits: "Reduces code size by 40%, improves maintainability"
    },
    %{
      type: "Combine operations",
      description: "Combined sequential Enum.map calls into a single operation",
      benefits: "Reduces intermediate list creation, improves performance"
    },
    %{
      type: "Add proper documentation",
      description: "Added module documentation with security warning and function docs with examples",
      benefits: "Improves code understandability and correct usage"
    },
    %{
      type: "Add helper function",
      description: "Created normalize_char/1 to handle negative character values",
      benefits: "Makes the normalization logic explicit and reusable"
    }
  ],
  expected_improvements: %{
    performance: "~20% faster for inputs longer than 100 characters due to reduced intermediate list creation",
    maintainability: "Significantly improved due to reduced duplication and better documentation",
    safety: "Slightly improved with explicit warnings about security limitations"
  }
}

Kino.DataTable.new(optimization_rationale.refactorings)
```

## AI in Optimization Evaluation

After generating optimizations, AI can evaluate their effectiveness:

```elixir
evaluation_data = """
Original implementation:
- Performance metrics: 2.5ms average execution time for 1000 character input
- Memory usage: Creates 4 intermediate lists per operation
- Cyclomatic complexity: 2 per function
- Duplication: 80% code duplication between functions

Optimized implementation:
- Performance metrics: 1.9ms average execution time for 1000 character input
- Memory usage: Creates 2 intermediate lists per operation
- Cyclomatic complexity: 1 per public function, 2 for private helper
- Duplication: 0% (extracted common functionality)
"""

evaluation_result = %{
  metrics: [
    %{metric: "Execution time", original: "2.5ms", optimized: "1.9ms", improvement: "24%"},
    %{metric: "Memory usage", original: "4 lists", optimized: "2 lists", improvement: "50%"},
    %{metric: "Code duplication", original: "80%", optimized: "0%", improvement: "100%"},
    %{metric: "Lines of code", original: "28", optimized: "32", improvement: "-14% (justified)"}
  ],
  success_rating: 0.85,
  recommendation: "Accept optimization",
  notes: "The slight increase in code size is justified by the improved structure, documentation, and elimination of duplication."
}

Kino.DataTable.new(evaluation_result.metrics)
```

## The AI Adaptation System in AshSwarm

AshSwarm implements these AI capabilities through three core modules:

1. **AICodeAnalysis**: Analyzes code to identify optimization opportunities
2. **AIAdaptationStrategies**: Generates optimized implementations
3. **AIExperimentEvaluation**: Evaluates the effectiveness of optimizations

Let's examine the core functionality of these modules:

### The Adaptation Process

```elixir
adaptation_process = %{
  steps: [
    %{
      step: "Code Analysis",
      module: "AICodeAnalysis",
      function: "analyze_code/2",
      description: "Examines code structure and identifies optimization opportunities"
    },
    %{
      step: "Optimization Generation",
      module: "AIAdaptationStrategies",
      function: "generate_optimized_implementation/3",
      description: "Creates optimized implementations based on analysis results"
    },
    %{
      step: "Experiment Design",
      module: "AIExperimentEvaluation",
      function: "design_experiment/3",
      description: "Designs experiments to evaluate optimizations"
    },
    %{
      step: "Optimization Evaluation",
      module: "AIExperimentEvaluation",
      function: "evaluate_experiment/4",
      description: "Evaluates optimization effectiveness using experiments"
    },
    %{
      step: "Adaptation Application",
      module: "AdaptiveCodeEvolution",
      function: "apply_adaptation/2",
      description: "Applies successful adaptations to the codebase"
    }
  ]
}

Kino.DataTable.new(adaptation_process.steps)
```

## AI Models and Performance Considerations

Different AI models offer varying capabilities for code analysis and optimization:

```elixir
model_comparison = [
  %{
    model: "llama3-8b-8192",
    strengths: "Fast, cost-effective, good for simple optimizations",
    limitations: "May struggle with complex code structures, limited reasoning depth",
    recommended_for: "Frequent, incremental optimizations of small functions"
  },
  %{
    model: "llama3-70b-8192",
    strengths: "Strong reasoning capabilities, high-quality optimizations, deeper analysis",
    limitations: "Higher computational cost, slower response times",
    recommended_for: "Complex optimizations, architectural improvements, critical code paths"
  },
  %{
    model: "gpt-4o",
    strengths: "Excellent comprehension of complex systems, state-of-the-art reasoning",
    limitations: "Highest cost, API-dependent, potential vendor lock-in",
    recommended_for: "System-level optimizations, critical performance bottlenecks"
  }
]

Kino.DataTable.new(model_comparison)
```
