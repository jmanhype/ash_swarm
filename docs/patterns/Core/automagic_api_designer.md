# Automagic API Designer

**Status**: Not Implemented

## Description

This pattern uses AI to analyze resource relationships and access patterns to automatically design optimal API endpoints. It leverages LLMs to understand how resources are used in an application and generates an intelligent API layer that balances performance, usability, and security concerns.

## Current Implementation

This pattern is not currently implemented in AshSwarm. There are no specific components in the codebase dedicated to automatically designing APIs based on resource analysis.

## Implementation Recommendations

To implement this pattern:

1. Create a system to analyze resource definitions, relationships, and usage patterns
2. Implement an LLM-powered module to generate API designs based on the analysis
3. Add tooling to create actual API endpoints from the designs
4. Implement testing and validation for the generated APIs
5. Create a feedback loop to improve the API designs based on usage metrics

## Potential Implementation

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.ApiDesigner do
  @moduledoc """
  Analyzes Ash resources and designs optimal API endpoints.
  """

  @doc """
  Analyzes resources and generates API design recommendations.
  
  Returns a map of API endpoints with configurations.
  """
  def analyze_resources(domains) when is_list(domains) do
    resource_analysis = gather_resource_info(domains)
    relationship_analysis = analyze_relationships(resource_analysis)
    access_patterns = predict_access_patterns(resource_analysis, relationship_analysis)
    
    generate_api_design(resource_analysis, relationship_analysis, access_patterns)
  end
  
  @doc """
  Applies the generated API design to the Ash API.
  
  Creates new API configurations based on the design.
  """
  def apply_design!(api_module, design) do
    # Implementation to generate the API configuration
    # and apply it to the specified module
  end
  
  # Private helper functions
  
  defp gather_resource_info(domains) do
    # Analyze all resources in the provided domains
  end
  
  defp analyze_relationships(resource_analysis) do
    # Analyze relationships between resources
  end
  
  defp predict_access_patterns(resources, relationships) do
    # Use LLM to predict likely access patterns
    prompt = build_access_pattern_prompt(resources, relationships)
    
    case AshSwarm.InstructorHelper.gen(
      %{access_patterns: [%{resource: :string, pattern: :string, frequency: :string}]},
      "You are an API design expert. Analyze these resources and predict access patterns.",
      prompt
    ) do
      {:ok, result} -> result.access_patterns
      {:error, _} -> []
    end
  end
  
  defp generate_api_design(resources, relationships, access_patterns) do
    # Use LLM to generate optimal API design
    prompt = build_api_design_prompt(resources, relationships, access_patterns)
    
    case AshSwarm.InstructorHelper.gen(
      %{endpoints: [%{path: :string, method: :string, resources: [:string], description: :string}]},
      "You are an API design expert. Design optimal API endpoints for these resources.",
      prompt
    ) do
      {:ok, result} -> result.endpoints
      {:error, _} -> []
    end
  end
end
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Optimal API Design**: Automatically creates API designs optimized for the specific domain
2. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent API patterns across the application
3. **Discovery**: May discover useful API endpoints that developers might not have considered
4. **Adaptation**: Can adjust API designs as the application evolves
5. **Reduced Development Time**: Automates a time-consuming design process
