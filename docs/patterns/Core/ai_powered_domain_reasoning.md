# AI-Powered Domain Reasoning â†’ Code Pipeline

**Status**: Partially Implemented

## Description

This pattern uses LLMs to analyze domain requirements, perform event storming sessions, and generate Ash resources. It bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation by leveraging AI to understand domain concepts and relationships.

## Current Implementation

The pattern is partially implemented in AshSwarm, with the most extensive example in the `ash_domain_reasoning.livemd` notebook. The implementation includes:

1. Using the `Instructor` library to structure LLM responses for domain modeling
2. The `AshSwarm.DomainReasoning` struct to capture the reasoning process and resources
3. Serialization/deserialization of domain models using `ToFromDSL` behavior

### Key Components

- `live_books/ash_domain_reasoning.livemd`: The main notebook demonstrating AI-powered domain reasoning
- `lib/ash_swarm/domain_reasoning.ex`: The struct representing domain reasoning output
- `lib/ash_swarm/to_from_dsl.ex`: Functionality for serializing/deserializing domain models
- `lib/ash_swarm/instructor_helper.ex`: Helper module for interacting with the Instructor library

### Example Usage

The livebook demonstrates using AI to:
1. Understand domain requirements
2. Identify key resources and their attributes
3. Model relationships between resources
4. Generate Ash resource DSL code

## Implementation Gaps

While the current implementation provides a guided process for using AI in domain modeling, it's not yet a complete pipeline:

1. No automated event storming analysis
2. Limited integration with code generation for complete resources
3. Manual intervention required between steps
4. No persistent storage of domain reasoning history

## Implementation Recommendations

To fully implement this pattern:

1. Create a Mix task to automate the pipeline from requirements to code
2. Implement event storming visualization and analysis
3. Develop a system to track reasoning changes over time
4. Add validation of generated resources against existing codebase
5. Implement automated code generation for complete resources with tests

## Code Examples

Current implementation in domain_reasoning.ex:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.DomainReasoning do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the domain reasoning structure.
  """

  use ToFromDSL

  defstruct [:resources, :steps, :final_answer]

  @impl true
  def model_dump(%__MODULE__{} = struct) do
    Map.from_struct(struct)
  end

  @impl true
  def model_validate(data) when is_map(data) do
    %__MODULE__{
      resources: Map.get(data, "resources") || Map.get(data, :resources, []),
      steps: Map.get(data, "steps") || Map.get(data, :steps, []),
      final_answer: Map.get(data, "final_answer") || Map.get(data, :final_answer)
    }
  end

  @impl true
  def model_dump_json(%__MODULE__{} = struct, opts \\ []) do
    indent = Keyword.get(opts, :indent, 2)
    Jason.encode!(Map.from_struct(struct), pretty: indent > 0)
  end
end
```
