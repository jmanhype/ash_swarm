# Cross-Resource State Machine Pattern

**Status**: Not Implemented

## Description

This pattern creates state machines that span multiple resources to model complex business processes. Unlike traditional state machines that operate within a single resource, cross-resource state machines coordinate state transitions across multiple related resources, ensuring consistency and proper business rule enforcement throughout the system.

## Current Implementation

This pattern is not currently implemented in AshSwarm. There are no specific components in the codebase dedicated to cross-resource state machines.

## Implementation Recommendations

To implement this pattern:

1. Create a state machine definition module that spans multiple resources
2. Implement transition rules that can affect multiple resources atomically
3. Add validation to ensure consistency across resources during transitions
4. Create visualization tools for understanding the multi-resource state machine
5. Implement testing utilities for verifying state machine correctness

## Potential Implementation

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.StateMachines.OrderFulfillment do
  use AshSwarm.CrossResourceStateMachine

  resources do
    resource :order, AshSwarm.Orders.Order
    resource :inventory, AshSwarm.Inventory.Item
    resource :shipment, AshSwarm.Shipping.Shipment
    resource :payment, AshSwarm.Payments.Transaction
  end

  states do
    initial :created
    state :payment_processing
    state :payment_confirmed
    state :inventory_reserved
    state :shipped
    state :delivered
    terminal :completed
    terminal :cancelled
  end

  transitions do
    transition :process_payment, from: :created, to: :payment_processing do
      condition fn %{order: order} -> order.total > 0 end
      affect :payment, fn payment, %{order: order} -> 
        # Process payment logic
      end
    end

    transition :confirm_payment, from: :payment_processing, to: :payment_confirmed do
      condition fn %{payment: payment} -> payment.status == :successful end
    end

    transition :reserve_inventory, from: :payment_confirmed, to: :inventory_reserved do
      affect :inventory, fn inventory, %{order: order} ->
        # Reserve inventory logic
      end
      on_failure :revert_payment, to: :created
    end

    # Additional transitions...
  end

  events do
    on :enter, :inventory_reserved do
      # Logic to execute when entering this state
    end

    on :exit, :payment_confirmed do
      # Logic to execute when exiting this state
    end
  end
end
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Business Process Integrity**: Ensures that complex processes involving multiple resources maintain integrity
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Centralizes state transition logic instead of duplicating it across resources
3. **Improved Visibility**: Makes the entire business process explicit and easier to understand
4. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent state transitions across related resources
