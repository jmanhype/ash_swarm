# Multi-Tenancy Aware Resource Pattern

## Status
**Not Implemented**

## Description
The Multi-Tenancy Aware Resource pattern extends Ash resources to handle multi-tenancy concerns elegantly, enabling applications to support multiple customers or organizations within a single deployment. The pattern focuses on dynamic tenant switching, isolation between tenants, and proper handling of tenant-specific data.

This pattern is essential for SaaS applications and any system where isolation between different users or organizations is required while maintaining a single codebase and deployment.

## Current Implementation
While AshSwarm doesn't currently have a specific implementation of this pattern, Ash Framework itself provides multi-tenancy capabilities that could be leveraged to implement this pattern in AshSwarm.

## Implementation Recommendations
To implement this pattern in AshSwarm, consider:

1. Creating a base module for multi-tenancy aware resources that:
   - Sets up the proper multi-tenancy strategy (attribute, context, or both)
   - Provides helper functions for tenant switching and isolation
   - Handles proper filtering and authorization based on tenancy

2. Implementing tenant management tools:
   - Resource for tenant management
   - APIs for tenant creation, update, and removal
   - Tenant-specific configuration options

3. Adding tenant migration capabilities:
   - Methods to move or copy data between tenants
   - Tools for data isolation verification

4. Ensuring proper integration with authorization:
   - Making sure tenant isolation is enforced in authorization rules
   - Preventing cross-tenant data access

## Potential Implementation

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.Patterns.MultiTenancyAwareResource do
  defmacro __using__(opts) do
    quote do
      use Ash.Resource, unquote(opts)
      
      multi_tenancy do
        strategy :context
        
        # Dynamic tenant determination
        attribute_strategy do
          attribute :tenant_id
          determine_tenant fn
            %{tenant_id: nil}, _context -> {:ok, nil}
            %{tenant_id: tenant_id}, _context -> {:ok, tenant_id}
          end
        end
        
        # Tenant isolation mechanisms
        global do
          # Resources/actions available across all tenants
        end
        
        tenant_isolation do
          # Tenant-specific behavior
        end
      end
      
      # Tenant migration capabilities
      actions do
        action :migrate_tenant, :update do
          argument :new_tenant_id, :string, allow_nil?: false
          argument :migration_strategy, :atom, 
            allow_nil?: false, 
            constraints: [one_of: [:copy, :move, :duplicate]]
            
          run fn input, _context ->
            # Implementation for tenant migration
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Benefits of Implementation
Implementing this pattern would provide several benefits:

1. **Customer Isolation**: Ensure complete isolation between tenant data, preventing accidental cross-tenant access.
2. **Simplified Development**: Standardized approach to multi-tenancy across all resources.
3. **Flexible Deployment Models**: Support for both single-tenant and multi-tenant deployments from the same codebase.
4. **Improved Security**: Better isolation between customers enhances overall application security.
5. **Easier Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements that mandate data separation.
