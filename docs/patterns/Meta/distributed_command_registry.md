# Distributed Command Registry Pattern

**Status:** Not Implemented

## Description

The Distributed Command Registry Pattern creates a self-organizing, fault-tolerant registry system for Ash Resource commands that operates seamlessly across a distributed BEAM cluster. This pattern enables commands to be discovered, registered, and coordinated automatically across multiple nodes, ensuring reliable command execution in distributed environments.

Unlike traditional command routing approaches that rely on fixed routing tables or centralized coordination, this pattern leverages the BEAM VM's built-in distribution capabilities to create an emergent, self-healing command registry. It ensures that commands can be executed reliably even in the face of node failures, network partitions, and dynamic cluster topology changes.

By integrating with OTP's `:pg` (or `:pg2` in older OTP versions) process groups and implementing consistent hashing algorithms, the pattern provides automatic command distribution with optimal load balancing while maintaining command execution guarantees.

## Key Components

### 1. Command Registry Definition

The pattern provides a declarative way to define distributed command registries:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CommandRegistry do
  use AshSwarm.DistributedCommandRegistry
  
  registry :orders do
    resource MyApp.Order
    sharding_strategy :consistent_hashing
    load_balancing :least_busy
    failover_strategy :auto_reassign
  end
  
  registry :users do
    resource MyApp.User
    sharding_strategy :by_attribute, attribute: :tenant_id
    load_balancing :round_robin
    failover_strategy :wait_for_node
    failover_timeout :timer.seconds(30)
  end
end
```

### 2. Command Routing and Execution

The pattern routes commands to the appropriate node based on the sharding strategy:

```elixir
# Client code - automatic routing
MyApp.Order
|> Ash.Query.filter(id == ^order_id)
|> MyApp.Orders.update!(%{status: "processing"})

# Under the hood:
defmodule AshSwarm.DistributedCommand do
  def route_command(command, registry_config) do
    # 1. Determine the target node using the sharding strategy
    target_node = determine_target_node(command, registry_config)
    
    # 2. Send the command to the target node
    case Node.self() do
      ^target_node ->
        # Execute locally
        execute_command(command)
      _ ->
        # Send to target node
        :erpc.call(target_node, __MODULE__, :execute_command, [command])
    end
  end
  
  def execute_command(command) do
    # Execute the command on the current node
    Ash.execute_command(command)
  end
  
  defp determine_target_node(command, registry_config) do
    case registry_config.sharding_strategy do
      {:consistent_hashing, _opts} ->
        command_key = extract_command_key(command)
        ConsistentHashing.get_node(command_key)
        
      {:by_attribute, %{attribute: attribute}} ->
        attribute_value = extract_attribute_value(command, attribute)
        attribute_hash = :erlang.phash2(attribute_value)
        nodes = Node.list() ++ [Node.self()]
        Enum.at(nodes, rem(attribute_hash, length(nodes)))
    end
  end
end
```

### 3. Fault Tolerance and Self-Healing

The pattern includes fault tolerance mechanisms to handle node failures:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor
  
  def start_link(opts) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    children = [
      {AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.NodeMonitor, []},
      {AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.CommandCoordinator, []},
      {AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.RebalanceManager, []}
    ]
    
    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end

defmodule AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.NodeMonitor do
  use GenServer
  
  # Monitors nodes and triggers rebalancing when nodes join/leave
  
  # ...implementation details...
  
  def handle_info({:nodedown, node}, state) do
    # Node went down, initiate failover for affected commands
    registry_configs = AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.list_registries()
    
    for config <- registry_configs do
      commands = get_commands_for_node(node, config)
      
      case config.failover_strategy do
        :auto_reassign ->
          reassign_commands(commands, Node.list() ++ [Node.self()])
          
        :wait_for_node ->
          schedule_timeout_check(commands, config.failover_timeout)
      end
    end
    
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

### 4. Load Balancing

The pattern implements different load balancing strategies:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.DistributedRegistry.LoadBalancer do
  def select_node(nodes, strategy, command) do
    case strategy do
      :least_busy ->
        nodes
        |> Enum.map(fn node -> {node, get_node_load(node)} end)
        |> Enum.min_by(fn {_node, load} -> load end)
        |> elem(0)
        
      :round_robin ->
        next_node = get_next_round_robin_node(nodes)
        update_round_robin_counter(next_node)
        next_node
    end
  end
  
  defp get_node_load(node) do
    case node do
      local when local == Node.self() ->
        # Use local scheduler info
        :erlang.statistics(:total_active_tasks)
        
      remote ->
        # Call remote node
        :erpc.call(remote, :erlang, :statistics, [:total_active_tasks])
    end
  end
end
```

## Implementation Recommendations

To effectively implement this pattern:

1. **Build on OTP Process Groups**: Leverage `:pg` for efficient process group management across nodes
2. **Implement Consistent Hashing**: Use consistent hashing algorithms to minimize command reassignment during topology changes
3. **Create Robust Failure Detection**: Implement reliable failure detection with appropriate timeouts
4. **Add Automatic Rebalancing**: Create mechanisms to rebalance commands when nodes join or leave
5. **Design Command Idempotency**: Ensure commands can be safely retried during failover scenarios
6. **Implement Back-Pressure**: Add back-pressure mechanisms to prevent command overload
7. **Provide Monitoring Tools**: Create tools to visualize command distribution and cluster health
8. **Support Local Execution Optimization**: Optimize for executing commands on the local node when possible

## Benefits

The Distributed Command Registry Pattern offers numerous benefits:

1. **Scalability**: Enables Ash applications to scale horizontally across multiple nodes
2. **Reliability**: Ensures commands continue executing even when nodes fail
3. **Performance**: Optimizes command execution through intelligent routing and load balancing
4. **Consistency**: Maintains consistent command execution semantics across the cluster
5. **Transparency**: Makes distribution transparent to application code
6. **Resilience**: Creates self-healing systems that adapt to changing cluster topology

## Potential Challenges

Implementing this pattern may present certain challenges:

1. **Complexity**: Managing distributed state and coordinating across nodes adds complexity
2. **Network Partitions**: Handling split-brain scenarios requires careful design
3. **Consistency Guarantees**: Balancing consistency and availability during partitions
4. **Performance Overhead**: Managing the performance impact of distribution
5. **Debugging Difficulty**: Debugging distributed systems is inherently more challenging

- **Hierarchical Multi-Level Reactor Pattern**: Can distribute reactor hierarchies across nodes
- **Event Sourcing Resource**: Can distribute event processing across nodes

## Conclusion

The Distributed Command Registry Pattern extends Ash's capabilities into the realm of distributed systems, enabling applications to scale horizontally while maintaining reliability and consistency. By leveraging the BEAM VM's distribution capabilities and implementing intelligent routing and failover strategies, this pattern creates resilient, scalable systems that can adapt to dynamic infrastructure environments.
