# Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern

**Status:** Implemented

## Description

The Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern creates a framework for software systems to continuously evolve and improve their code structure and behavior over time without direct human intervention. This pattern leverages the Igniter framework's capabilities to enable code to analyze itself, identify improvement opportunities, and implement those improvements automatically.

Unlike traditional static code generation, this pattern creates a living, evolving codebase that can:

1. Analyze its own structure and usage patterns
2. Identify optimization opportunities based on predefined heuristics
3. Generate and apply patches to improve itself incrementally
4. Track the effectiveness of changes and learn from the results
5. Roll back unsuccessful changes when necessary

By implementing this pattern using [Igniter](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter), applications can achieve gradual, continuous improvement that responds to actual usage patterns rather than just following predefined templates.

## Current Implementation

AshSwarm provides a full implementation of the Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern in the following modules:

- `AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveCodeEvolution`: The core behavior module that defines the pattern
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.UsageStats`: Provides usage tracking for modules and functions
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.CodeAnalysis`: Utilities for analyzing code patterns
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.QueryEvolution`: A concrete implementation focused on query optimization
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveScheduler`: Schedules periodic code evolution

The pattern builds on several Ash ecosystem foundations:
- Igniter provides code analysis and transformation
- The Ash query engine optimizes queries based on usage patterns
- Ash extensions adapt their behavior based on configuration

## Implementation Details

### Code Analysis and Pattern Recognition

The implementation uses Elixir's metaprogramming facilities, combined with Igniter, to analyze code structure and identify patterns that could be optimized. Some of the patterns detected include:

- Nested filtering expressions in Ash resource queries
- Inefficient use of relationships
- Redundant code patterns
- Functionally equivalent but less efficient code

### Usage Tracking

The pattern tracks how modules and functions are used in the application:

- Call frequency
- Common argument patterns
- Execution context information
- Execution time and memory usage

This data is stored in an ETS table for efficient access and analysis. Over time, this usage data provides insights into which parts of the codebase would benefit most from optimization.

### Adaptation Strategies

Based on code analysis and usage tracking, the system suggests adaptations using strategies such as:

- Combining nested filters for more efficient queries
- Restructuring code based on usage patterns
- Preloading relationships based on access patterns
- Optimizing functions based on common argument values

### Experimentation and Verification

Before applying changes, the system:

1. Creates temporary copies of modules
2. Applies suggested optimizations
3. Runs benchmark tests to measure improvements
4. Compares performance against the original
5. Only applies changes that demonstrate a significant improvement

This experimental approach ensures that changes are beneficial and safe before they are applied to the actual codebase.

### Scheduled Evolution

The system includes a scheduler that can run the adaptive evolution process at specific times:

- During low-traffic periods
- Daily, hourly, or at specific times
- On-demand when needed

This allows the codebase to continuously evolve and improve itself based on actual usage patterns.

## Usage Example

### Defining a Query Evolution Module

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CodeEvolution do
  use AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveCodeEvolution
  
  # Define a code analyzer for query functions
  code_analyzer :query_analyzer,
    description: "Analyzes resource queries for inefficient patterns",
    analyzer: fn module_info, _options ->
      # Implementation details...
    end
  
  # Define a usage tracker for query functions
  usage_tracker :query_usage_tracker,
    description: "Tracks query usage patterns",
    tracker: fn module, action, context ->
      # Track usage...
    end
  
  # Define an adaptation strategy based on query analysis and usage
  adaptation_strategy :query_optimization_strategy,
    description: "Suggests optimizations for inefficient queries",
    strategy: fn analysis_results, _options ->
      # Suggest optimizations...
    end
  
  # Define an experiment to test query optimizations
  experiment :query_optimization_experiment,
    description: "Tests query optimization strategies",
    setup: fn module, _options ->
      # Setup experiment...
    end,
    run: fn _module, setup_data, options ->
      # Run experiment...
    end,
    evaluate: fn _module, run_result, _options ->
      # Evaluate results...
    end,
    cleanup: fn _module, setup_data, _run_result, status ->
      # Cleanup...
    end
end
```

### Creating Self-Optimizing Resources

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Resources.Product do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: Ash.DataLayer.Ets
    
  alias MyApp.CodeEvolution

  attributes do
    # Resource attributes...
  end
  
  actions do
    # Actions...
    
    read :by_category do
      argument :category_id, :uuid
      
      filter expr(category_id == ^arg(:category_id))
      
      # Hook to track usage patterns
      prepare fn query, context ->
        # Track that this action was used
        CodeEvolution.track_usage(
          __MODULE__, 
          :by_category, 
          %{args: context.arguments}
        )
        
        {:ok, query}
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Initialize adaptive behavior
  def init_adaptive_behavior do
    # Schedule periodic evolution
    AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveScheduler.schedule_evolution(__MODULE__, "daily")
  end
end
```

### Starting the Adaptive Evolution System

In your application supervision tree:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    # Other services...
    
    # Start the UsageStats server
    {AshSwarm.Foundations.UsageStats, []},
    
    # Start the AdaptiveScheduler
    {AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveScheduler, []},
    
    # Other services...
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Self-Improving Codebase**: The codebase continuously improves itself based on actual usage.

2. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Optimizations are made based on real-world usage data rather than assumptions.

3. **Targeted Improvements**: Resources are spent optimizing the most frequently used or problematic code.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Experimental changes can be tested thoroughly before being applied.

5. **Knowledge Accumulation**: The system learns from past optimizations to make better decisions over time.

6. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Regular, incremental improvements help prevent the accumulation of technical debt.

7. **Automatic Adaptation**: Code automatically adapts to changing usage patterns without manual intervention.

8. **Empirical Evolution**: Evolution decisions are based on empirical evidence rather than intuition.

## Challenges and Limitations

1. **Safety**: Ensuring that automated changes don't introduce bugs is challenging and requires robust testing.

2. **Integration**: Dynamic code changes may require recompilation and could affect live systems.

3. **Complexity**: The system's complexity can make it difficult to understand and debug.

4. **Predictability**: Automated changes can make the system's behavior less predictable over time.

5. **Overhead**: Tracking usage and analyzing code adds some runtime and memory overhead.

## Future Enhancements

Future versions of this pattern could include:

1. **Machine Learning**: Using ML to identify more complex optimization patterns.

2. **Cross-Module Analysis**: Extending analysis beyond single modules to identify cross-module optimization opportunities.

3. **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporating user feedback into the evolution process.

4. **Adaptive DSL Evolution**: Extending the pattern to Ash DSL definitions to optimize resource definitions.

5. **Compatibility Analysis**: Ensuring changes are compatible with API contracts and client expectations.
