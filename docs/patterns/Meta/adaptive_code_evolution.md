# Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern

**Status:** Implemented

## Description

The Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern creates a framework for software systems to continuously evolve and improve their code structure and behavior over time without direct human intervention. This pattern leverages both the Igniter framework's capabilities and language models through Instructor Ex to enable code to analyze itself, identify improvement opportunities, and implement those improvements automatically.

Unlike traditional static code generation, this pattern creates a living, evolving codebase that can:

1. Analyze its own structure and usage patterns through both static analysis and AI-powered insights
2. Identify optimization opportunities based on predefined heuristics and language model reasoning
3. Generate and apply patches to improve itself incrementally
4. Track the effectiveness of changes and learn from the results
5. Roll back unsuccessful changes when necessary

By implementing this pattern using [Igniter](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter) for code manipulation and [Instructor Ex](https://github.com/thmsmlr/instructor_ex) for intelligent analysis, applications can achieve gradual, continuous improvement that responds to actual usage patterns rather than just following predefined templates.

## Current Implementation

AshSwarm now includes a full implementation of the Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern in the `AshSwarm.Foundations` namespace:

- `AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveCodeEvolution`: Core implementation providing the DSL and functionality for adaptive code evolution
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.UsageStats`: Tracks and analyzes code usage patterns to inform optimization decisions
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.CodeAnalysis`: Analyzes code structure to identify patterns and optimization opportunities
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.QueryEvolution`: Specialized implementation for optimizing database queries
- `AshSwarm.Foundations.AICodeAnalysis`: AI-powered code analyzer that uses language models to suggest optimizations

This implementation creates a closed feedback loop system where code can observe its own performance, make decisions about improvements, and implement those improvements autonomously using both Igniter to transform code safely and Instructor Ex to provide intelligent analysis and suggestions.

## Enhanced Implementation with AI Integration

The pattern now incorporates language models through Instructor Ex to enhance each step of the adaptive evolution process:

### 1. AI-Powered Code Analysis

Language models analyze code to identify optimization opportunities beyond what rule-based systems can detect:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.Foundations.AICodeAnalysis do
  @moduledoc """
  Uses language models via Instructor Ex to analyze code and suggest optimizations.
  """
  
  alias AshSwarm.InstructorHelper
  
  @doc """
  Analyzes code to find optimization opportunities using language models.
  """
  def analyze_code(module, options \\ []) do
    # Extract code content using Igniter
    igniter = Igniter.new()
    {:ok, {_igniter, source, _zipper}} = Igniter.Project.Module.find_module(igniter, module)
    
    # Define the response model for structured LLM output
    response_model = %{
      optimization_opportunities: [
        %{
          type: :string,
          location: :string,
          severity: :string,
          description: :string,
          suggested_change: :string,
          rationale: :string
        }
      ]
    }
    
    # Prepare prompt for the language model
    sys_msg = """
    You are an expert Elixir code analyzer specializing in identifying optimization opportunities.
    Analyze the provided code and suggest specific improvements that would enhance performance,
    readability, or maintainability.
    """
    
    user_msg = """
    Module: #{inspect(module)}
    
    Code:
    ```elixir
    #{source}
    ```
    
    Please identify optimization opportunities in this code.
    """
    
    # Use Instructor Ex to get structured analysis
    case InstructorHelper.gen(response_model, sys_msg, user_msg) do
      {:ok, result} -> 
        {:ok, result.optimization_opportunities}
      
      {:error, reason} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. Intelligent Adaptation Strategies

Language models help craft custom adaptation strategies based on the specific context:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.Foundations.AIAdaptationStrategies do
  @moduledoc """
  Uses language models to generate and refine code adaptation strategies.
  """
  
  alias AshSwarm.InstructorHelper
  
  @doc """
  Generates an optimized implementation for a given code section based on usage patterns.
  """
  def generate_optimized_implementation(original_code, usage_patterns, options \\ []) do
    response_model = %{
      optimized_code: :string,
      explanation: :string,
      expected_improvements: %{
        performance: :string,
        maintainability: :string,
        safety: :string
      }
    }
    
    sys_msg = """
    You are an expert Elixir code optimizer. Generate an improved implementation
    of the provided code based on the usage patterns.
    """
    
    user_msg = """
    Original code:
    ```elixir
    #{original_code}
    ```
    
    Usage patterns:
    #{inspect(usage_patterns)}
    
    Generate an optimized implementation that addresses these usage patterns.
    """
    
    InstructorHelper.gen(response_model, sys_msg, user_msg)
  end
end
```

### 3. Experiment Evaluation

Language models help assess the success of code adaptations:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.Foundations.AIExperimentEvaluation do
  @moduledoc """
  Uses language models to evaluate the outcomes of code adaptation experiments.
  """
  
  alias AshSwarm.InstructorHelper
  
  @doc """
  Evaluates the outcomes of a code adaptation experiment using language models.
  """
  def evaluate_experiment(original_code, adapted_code, metrics, options \\ []) do
    response_model = %{
      evaluation: %{
        success_rating: :float,
        recommendation: :string,
        risks: [:string],
        improvement_areas: [:string]
      },
      explanation: :string
    }
    
    sys_msg = """
    You are an expert Elixir code reviewer specialized in evaluating code adaptations.
    Analyze the original code, the adapted code, and the performance metrics to
    determine if the adaptation was successful.
    """
    
    user_msg = """
    Original code:
    ```elixir
    #{original_code}
    ```
    
    Adapted code:
    ```elixir
    #{adapted_code}
    ```
    
    Performance metrics:
    #{inspect(metrics)}
    
    Evaluate whether this adaptation was successful and should be applied.
    """
    
    InstructorHelper.gen(response_model, sys_msg, user_msg)
  end
end
```

## Implementation Recommendations

To fully implement the AI-enhanced Adaptive Code Evolution Pattern:

1. **Create usage tracking systems**: Implement mechanisms to track how code is being used in production.

2. **Design hybrid analysis tools**: Develop analyzers that combine static analysis with AI-powered insights.

3. **Implement LLM-enhanced heuristic engines**: Create engines that leverage both domain-specific knowledge and language model reasoning to suggest improvements.

4. **Build adaptive generators**: Create code generators that adapt based on usage statistics, performance metrics, and AI suggestions.

5. **Develop experimentation frameworks**: Enable safe experimentation with code changes in controlled environments, with AI evaluation of results.

6. **Create learning systems**: Implement mechanisms to learn from the success or failure of past adaptations, using language models to enhance this learning.

7. **Design versioning and rollback**: Ensure changes can be tracked and rolled back if they don't achieve desired outcomes.

    end,
    run: fn setup_data, options ->
      # Run the experiment and collect metrics
      {:ok, metrics}
    end,
    evaluate: fn original, adapted, metrics, options ->
      # First, perform traditional metric-based evaluation
      traditional_evaluation = evaluate_metrics(metrics)
      
      # Then, enhance with AI evaluation
      case AshSwarm.Foundations.AIExperimentEvaluation.evaluate_experiment(
        original,
        adapted,
        metrics
      ) do
        {:ok, ai_evaluation} ->
          # Combine evaluations, weighing both metric analysis and AI insights
          final_evaluation = combine_evaluations(traditional_evaluation, ai_evaluation)
          
          if final_evaluation.success_rating > 0.7 do
            {:ok, :success, final_evaluation}
          else
            {:ok, :failure, final_evaluation}
          end
          
        {:error, _} ->
          # Fall back to traditional evaluation if AI evaluation fails
          if traditional_evaluation.improvement > 0.2 do
            {:ok, :success, traditional_evaluation}
          else
            {:ok, :failure, traditional_evaluation}
          end
      end
    end
end

# Example usage of the AI-enhanced adaptive code evolution system
defmodule MyApp.AdaptiveManager do
  def evolve_codebase do
    # Start by analyzing all modules with high usage
    modules_to_evolve = AshSwarm.Foundations.UsageStats.get_high_usage_modules()
    
    Enum.each(modules_to_evolve, fn module ->
      # Analyze the module using both static analysis and AI
      analysis_results = MyApp.CodeEvolution.analyze(module, analyzer: :hybrid_analyzer)
      
      # For each optimization opportunity, apply the appropriate strategy
      Enum.each(analysis_results.opportunities, fn opportunity ->
        # For complex optimizations, use the AI-powered strategy
        if opportunity.complexity > 0.7 do
          MyApp.CodeEvolution.adapt(
            module,
            opportunity,
            strategy: :ai_optimization
          )
        else
          # For simpler optimizations, use traditional strategies
          MyApp.CodeEvolution.adapt(
            module,
            opportunity,
            strategy: :traditional_optimization
          )
        end
      end)
    end)
  end
end
```

## Benefits of AI Integration

Integrating AI through Instructor Ex into the Adaptive Code Evolution pattern provides several key advantages:

1. **More sophisticated pattern recognition**: Language models can identify complex patterns and anti-patterns that rule-based systems might miss.

2. **Contextual understanding**: AI can understand the semantic meaning of code, not just its syntax, enabling more intelligent optimization suggestions.

3. **Creative optimizations**: Language models can suggest novel approaches to optimization that might not be covered by predefined rules.

4. **Natural language explanations**: AI can provide clear, human-readable explanations for why certain optimizations are beneficial.

5. **Continuous learning**: As the system evolves, language models can incorporate new patterns and best practices, keeping the optimization strategies current.

By combining the precision of static analysis tools like Igniter with the intelligence and flexibility of language models through Instructor Ex, the Adaptive Code Evolution pattern becomes a powerful framework for creating truly self-improving codebases.
