# Recursive Domain Composition Pattern

**Status:** Not Implemented

## Description

The Recursive Domain Composition Pattern enables the nested composition of entire domain models, allowing complex domain hierarchies to be built from smaller, reusable domain components. It leverages Ash's domains and extends them with recursive composition capabilities, enabling true domain-driven design with proper bounded contexts and explicit relationships between domains.

Unlike traditional domain modeling approaches that create monolithic domain structures or rely on implicit connections between domains, this pattern provides explicit mechanisms for:

1. Nesting and composing domains to create hierarchical domain structures
2. Defining clear boundaries and interfaces between domains
3. Establishing well-defined relationships across domain boundaries
4. Managing cross-domain dependencies and data flow
5. Enforcing authorization and access control at domain boundaries

By extending Ash's domain capabilities with compositional features, this pattern enables the development of complex, modular systems while maintaining clear separation of concerns and explicit interdomain contracts.

## Key Components

### 1. Domain Composition Definition

The pattern provides a declarative way to compose domains:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CommerceDomain do
  use Ash.Domain,
    extensions: [AshSwarm.RecursiveDomainComposition]
    
  composition do
    include_domain MyApp.ProductDomain
    include_domain MyApp.OrderDomain
    include_domain MyApp.CustomerDomain
    
    relationship do
      from MyApp.ProductDomain.Product
      to MyApp.OrderDomain.OrderItem
      type :has_many
      define_in :both
    end
    
    boundary :customer_management do
      expose MyApp.CustomerDomain.Customer
      expose MyApp.CustomerDomain.Address
    end
    
    boundary :order_processing do
      expose MyApp.OrderDomain.Order
      expose MyApp.OrderDomain.OrderItem
      expose MyApp.ProductDomain.Product, actions: [:read]
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. Cross-Domain Relationships

The pattern manages relationships between resources in different domains:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.RecursiveDomainComposition.RelationshipManager do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages cross-domain relationships.
  """
  
  def define_cross_domain_relationship(relationship_config) do
    %{
      from: from_resource,
      to: to_resource,
      type: relationship_type,
      define_in: define_in,
      name: relationship_name
    } = relationship_config
    
    case define_in do
      :source ->
        define_relationship_in_source(from_resource, to_resource, relationship_type, relationship_name)
        
      :destination ->
        define_relationship_in_destination(from_resource, to_resource, relationship_type, relationship_name)
        
      :both ->
        define_relationship_in_source(from_resource, to_resource, relationship_type, relationship_name)
        define_relationship_in_destination(from_resource, to_resource, relationship_type, relationship_name)
    end
  end
  
  defp define_relationship_in_source(from_resource, to_resource, type, name) do
    # Define relationship in the source resource
    # Implementation details...
  end
  
  defp define_relationship_in_destination(from_resource, to_resource, type, name) do
    # Define relationship in the destination resource
    # Implementation details...
  end
end
```

### 3. Domain Boundaries

The pattern establishes clear boundaries between domains:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.RecursiveDomainComposition.BoundaryManager do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages domain boundaries and access control.
  """
  
  def define_boundary(boundary_name, exposed_resources, parent_domain) do
    # Create a boundary module
    boundary_module = Module.concat(parent_domain, Boundary.camelize(boundary_name))
    
    Module.create(boundary_module, quote do
      @moduledoc """
      Boundary module for #{boundary_name} in #{inspect(parent_domain)}.
      """
      
      @exposed_resources unquote(Macro.escape(exposed_resources))
      
      def exposed_resources do
        @exposed_resources
      end
      
      def authorize_access(resource, action, actor) do
        # Implement boundary-specific authorization
        # ...implementation details...
      end
    end, Macro.Env.location(__ENV__))
    
    boundary_module
  end
  
  def get_boundary_for_resource(resource, parent_domain) do
    # Find which boundary a resource belongs to
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  def validate_boundary_access(resource, action, actor, parent_domain) do
    boundary = get_boundary_for_resource(resource, parent_domain)
    
    if boundary do
      boundary.authorize_access(resource, action, actor)
    else
      {:error, :resource_not_exposed}
    end
  end
end
```

### 4. Dependency Resolution

The pattern includes dependency resolution for proper domain loading:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.RecursiveDomainComposition.DependencyResolver do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves dependencies between composed domains.
  """
  
  def resolve_domain_dependencies(domains) do
    # Build dependency graph
    graph = build_dependency_graph(domains)
    
    # Topologically sort domains based on dependencies
    case Libgraph.topsort(graph) do
      {:ok, sorted_domains} ->
        {:ok, sorted_domains}
        
      {:error, cycle} ->
        {:error, {:circular_dependency, cycle}}
    end
  end
  
  defp build_dependency_graph(domains) do
    # Create a directed graph of domain dependencies
    graph = Libgraph.new(type: :directed)
    
    # Add all domains as vertices
    graph = Enum.reduce(domains, graph, fn domain, acc ->
      Libgraph.add_vertex(acc, domain)
    end)
    
    # Add edges for dependencies
    Enum.reduce(domains, graph, fn domain, acc ->
      dependencies = get_domain_dependencies(domain)
      
      Enum.reduce(dependencies, acc, fn dependency, inner_acc ->
        Libgraph.add_edge(inner_acc, dependency, domain)
      end)
    end)
  end
  
  defp get_domain_dependencies(domain) do
    # Extract dependencies from a domain's composition
    # ...implementation details...
  end
end
```

## Implementation Recommendations

To effectively implement this pattern:

1. **Extend Ash.Domain**: Create an extension for Ash.Domain that adds composition capabilities
2. **Build Relationship Management**: Implement cross-domain relationship definitions and management

2. **Clear Boundaries**: Establishes explicit boundaries between domains
3. **Dependency Management**: Provides tools for managing domain dependencies
4. **Reusability**: Allows domains to be reused across different applications
5. **Scalability**: Supports scaling development across multiple teams with clear interfaces
6. **Maintainability**: Improves maintainability through clear separation of concerns
7. **Domain-Driven Design**: Enables true domain-driven design with bounded contexts

## Potential Challenges

Implementing this pattern may present certain challenges:

1. **Complexity Management**: Managing the complexity of deeply nested domain hierarchies
2. **Performance Overhead**: Potential performance impact of boundary enforcement
3. **Learning Curve**: Steeper learning curve for developers new to the pattern
4. **Boundary Design**: Designing appropriate domain boundaries
5. **Integration Issues**: Integrating with existing Ash extensions and patterns

## Related Patterns

This pattern relates to several other architectural patterns:

- **Resource-Driven State Machines**: Can be integrated with domain composition
- **Hierarchical Multi-Level Reactor Pattern**: Can be combined for complex workflows
- **Dynamic DSL Extension**: Can be used to extend domain compositions at runtime

## Conclusion

The Recursive Domain Composition Pattern extends Ash's domain capabilities to support complex, hierarchical domain structures with clear boundaries and explicit relationships. By providing tools for composing, connecting, and managing domains, this pattern enables the development of large, modular systems that maintain the advantages of domain-driven design while supporting reuse and composition of domain components. This approach aligns well with Elixir's emphasis on modularity and the BEAM's support for building large, distributed systems.
