# Auto-Scaling Dataloader Pattern

**Status:** Not Implemented

## Description

The Auto-Scaling Dataloader Pattern enhances Ash's data loading capabilities with intelligent concurrency management that automatically scales based on system load, data volume, and query complexity. This pattern leverages Elixir's process-based concurrency model to create a self-tuning system that optimizes data loading performance while preventing system overload.

Unlike traditional dataloaders with fixed concurrency settings, this pattern continuously adapts its behavior by:

1. Dynamically adjusting the parallelism level based on current system conditions
2. Applying backpressure mechanisms when system load is high
3. Optimizing resource utilization based on query characteristics
4. Intelligently batching and scheduling data loading operations
5. Learning from past performance to predict optimal settings for future operations

By combining Elixir's lightweight processes with sophisticated concurrency management algorithms, this pattern enables Ash applications to efficiently handle highly variable workloads while maintaining system stability and optimal performance.

## Key Components

### 1. Auto-Scaling Dataloader Definition

The pattern provides a configurable dataloader with adaptive concurrency:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start_link(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {AshSwarm.AutoScalingDataloader,
        name: MyApp.Dataloader,
        initial_concurrency: 10,
        max_concurrency: 100,
        min_concurrency: 2,
        scaling_strategy: :adaptive,
        metrics_window: :timer.seconds(30),
        target_utilization: 0.75,
        backpressure_threshold: 0.9
      }
    ]
    
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

### 2. Adaptive Concurrency Management

The pattern implements adaptive concurrency controls:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.AutoScalingDataloader.ConcurrencyManager do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages concurrency levels for the auto-scaling dataloader.
  """
  
  def adjust_concurrency(metrics, config) do
    current_concurrency = metrics.current_concurrency
    system_load = get_system_load()
    recent_throughput = metrics.operations_per_second
    error_rate = metrics.error_rate
    
    cond do
      # Scale down if error rate is high
      error_rate > 0.05 ->
        scale_down(current_concurrency, config.min_concurrency)
        
      # Scale down if system load is very high
      system_load > config.backpressure_threshold ->
        scale_down(current_concurrency, config.min_concurrency)
        
      # Scale up if system load is low and we're not at max
      system_load < config.target_utilization && current_concurrency < config.max_concurrency ->
        scale_up(current_concurrency, config.max_concurrency)
        
      # Scale down if throughput hasn't improved with more concurrency
      not improved_throughput?(metrics.historical_throughput, recent_throughput) ->
        scale_down(current_concurrency, config.min_concurrency)
        
      true ->
        # No change needed
        current_concurrency
    end
  end
  
  defp get_system_load do
    # Get current system load metrics
    {total_active_tasks, _} = :erlang.statistics(:total_active_tasks)
    {total_run_queue, _} = :erlang.statistics(:total_run_queue_lengths)
    scheduler_count = :erlang.system_info(:schedulers_online)
    
    # Calculate normalized system load
    (total_active_tasks + total_run_queue) / (scheduler_count * 1.5)
  end
  
  defp scale_up(current, max) do
    new_concurrency = min(current * 1.5, max) |> round()
    max(new_concurrency, current + 1)
  end
  
  defp scale_down(current, min) do
    new_concurrency = max(current * 0.8, min) |> round()
    min(new_concurrency, current - 1)
  end
  
  defp improved_throughput?(historical, current) do
    # Check if throughput has improved with increased concurrency
    # ...implementation details...
  end
end
```

### 3. Intelligent Query Batching

The pattern implements sophisticated query batching:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.AutoScalingDataloader.BatchManager do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages query batching for the auto-scaling dataloader.
  """
  
  def batch_queries(queries, metrics, config) do
    average_query_time = metrics.average_query_time_ms
    current_concurrency = metrics.current_concurrency
    
    # Determine optimal batch size
    batch_size = calculate_optimal_batch_size(
      average_query_time,
      current_concurrency,
      config.target_response_time_ms
    )
    
    # Group similar queries together
    grouped_queries = group_similar_queries(queries)
    
    # Split into batches
    batches = create_batches(grouped_queries, batch_size)
    
    # Schedule batches
    schedule_batches(batches, config)
  end
  
  defp calculate_optimal_batch_size(avg_time, concurrency, target_time) do
    # Calculate optimal batch size based on performance metrics
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  defp group_similar_queries(queries) do
    # Group queries by resource type, preloads, filters, etc.
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  defp create_batches(grouped_queries, batch_size) do
    # Create batches from grouped queries
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  defp schedule_batches(batches, config) do
    # Schedule batches for execution
    # ...implementation details...
  end
end
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring and Learning

The pattern includes performance monitoring and learning capabilities:

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.AutoScalingDataloader.MetricsCollector do
  @moduledoc """
  Collects and analyzes metrics for the auto-scaling dataloader.
  """
  
  use GenServer
  
  # Client API
  
  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  def record_operation(operation_type, duration_ms, result) do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:record_operation, operation_type, duration_ms, result})
  end
  
  def get_metrics do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :get_metrics)
  end
  
  # Server callbacks
  
  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    # Initialize metrics storage
    metrics = %{
      operations: [],
      error_count: 0,
      success_count: 0,
      total_duration_ms: 0,
      historical_throughput: []
    }
    
    # Schedule periodic metrics analysis
    schedule_metrics_analysis()
    
    {:ok, %{metrics: metrics, config: opts}}
  end
  
  @impl true
  def handle_cast({:record_operation, operation_type, duration_ms, result}, state) do
    # Update metrics with new operation data
    metrics = update_metrics(state.metrics, operation_type, duration_ms, result)
    
    {:noreply, %{state | metrics: metrics}}
  end
  
  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_metrics, _from, state) do
    # Calculate derived metrics
    computed_metrics = compute_derived_metrics(state.metrics)
    
    {:reply, computed_metrics, state}
  end
  
  @impl true
  def handle_info(:analyze_metrics, state) do
    # Perform periodic metrics analysis
    # ...implementation details...
    
    # Schedule next analysis
    schedule_metrics_analysis()
    
    {:noreply, state}
  end
  
  # Helper functions
  
  defp update_metrics(metrics, operation_type, duration_ms, result) do
    # Update metrics with new operation data
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  defp compute_derived_metrics(metrics) do
    # Calculate derived metrics like throughput, error rate, etc.
    # ...implementation details...
  end
  
  defp schedule_metrics_analysis do
    Process.send_after(self(), :analyze_metrics, :timer.seconds(5))
  end
end
```
