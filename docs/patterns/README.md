# AshSwarm Advanced Patterns

This documentation catalogs the advanced patterns implemented or proposed for the AshSwarm framework. These patterns represent innovative approaches that leverage the Ash Framework in conjunction with AI capabilities.

## Pattern Categories

The patterns are organized into the following categories:

- **Core**: Fully implemented patterns that form the foundation of AshSwarm
- **Emerging**: Partially implemented patterns that are in active development
- **Data**: Patterns focused on data management, aggregation, and storage
- **Integration**: Patterns for integrating AshSwarm with external systems
- **Security**: Patterns related to authorization and security
- **Multi-tenancy**: Patterns for building multi-tenant applications
