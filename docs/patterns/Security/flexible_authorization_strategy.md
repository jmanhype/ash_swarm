# Flexible Authorization Strategy Pattern

## Status
**Not Implemented**

## Description
The Flexible Authorization Strategy pattern provides a comprehensive approach to authorization that can combine multiple strategies including role-based, attribute-based, and policy-based access control. This pattern extends Ash's authorization capabilities to support complex business rules, hierarchical permissions, and context-aware authorization decisions.

This pattern is particularly valuable for applications with complex authorization requirements, multi-tenant systems, or those needing fine-grained access control.

## Current Implementation
AshSwarm does not currently implement this pattern. While Ash Framework provides authorization capabilities, there is no comprehensive flexible authorization strategy implementation in the current codebase.

## Implementation Recommendations
To implement this pattern in AshSwarm, consider:

1. Creating a flexible authorization extension:
   - Support for combining multiple authorization strategies
   - Dynamic policy loading and evaluation
   - Integration with external policy services

2. Implementing hierarchical role management:
   - Define role hierarchies and inheritance
   - Support for role-based access control
   - Tools for managing roles and permissions

3. Adding context-aware policy evaluation:
   - Evaluate policies based on request context
   - Support for complex business rules
   - Integration with AI for policy recommendations

4. Building authorization monitoring and debugging:
   - Tools to understand authorization decisions
   - Audit logs for authorization attempts
   - Testing utilities for authorization rules

## Potential Implementation

```elixir
defmodule AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization do
  defmacro __using__(opts) do
    quote do
      use Ash.Resource, unquote(opts)
      
      # Combine multiple authorization strategies
      authorization do
        # Role-based access control
        roles do
          role :admin, ["manage"], "Full system access"
          role :user, ["read", "create"], "Standard user access"
          # Additional roles
        end
        
        # Attribute-based policies
        policies do
          policy action_type(:read) do
            authorize_if attribute_equals(:public, true)
            authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:creator)
          end
          
          policy action(:update) do
            authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:creator)
            authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:role, :admin)
          end
          
          # Dynamic policy loading from external source
          policy :external do
            authorize_by AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization.check_external_policy()
          end
        end
        
        # Hierarchical role definitions
        role_hierarchy do
          parent :admin, [:moderator, :user]
          parent :moderator, [:user]
        end
        
        # Context-aware checks
        context_checks do
          check :business_hours do
            fn _resource, _actor, context ->
              current_time = Map.get(context, :current_time, DateTime.utc_now())
              
              with {:ok, hour} <- DateTime.to_time(current_time) |> Map.fetch(:hour) do
                hour >= 9 && hour < 17
              else
                _ -> false
              end
            end
          end
          
          check :rate_limited do
            fn _resource, actor, _context ->
              # Rate limiting implementation
              AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization.check_rate_limit(actor)
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  # External policy check implementation
  def check_external_policy(resource, actor, action) do
    # Implementation for checking external policies
    # Could integrate with external policy service or AI-based policy evaluation
    {:ok, true}
  end
  
  # Rate limiting check
  def check_rate_limit(actor) do
    # Implementation for rate limiting
    {:ok, true}
  end
  
  # Policy evaluation with explanation
  def explain_authorization(resource, actor, action) do
    resource_module = resource.__struct__
    
    # Evaluate each policy and collect results with explanations
    resource_module.__authorization__()
    |> Map.get(:policies, [])
    |> Enum.map(fn policy ->
      {policy.name, evaluate_policy(policy, resource, actor, action)}
    end)
  end
  
  # Policy evaluation
  defp evaluate_policy(policy, resource, actor, action) do
    # Implementation for policy evaluation
    %{
      authorized: true,
      reason: "Policy evaluation logic would go here"
    }
  end
end
```

## Usage Example

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Resources.Document do
  use AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization
  
  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    
    attribute :title, :string
    attribute :content, :string
    attribute :public, :boolean, default: false
    attribute :sensitivity_level, :integer, default: 0
    
    timestamps()
  end
  
  relationships do
    belongs_to :creator, MyApp.Resources.User
    belongs_to :organization, MyApp.Resources.Organization
  end
  
  # Custom authorization policies
  authorization do
    policies do
      # Policy based on document sensitivity
      policy :sensitive_document do
        condition expr(sensitivity_level > 2)
        authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:clearance_level, [3, 4, 5])
      end
      
      # Policy with AI-powered evaluation
      policy :ai_content_policy do
        authorize_by fn document, actor, _context ->
          AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization.evaluate_with_ai(
            document.content,
            actor
          )
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Resource definition...
end

# Checking authorization
{:ok, explanation} = AshSwarm.Patterns.FlexibleAuthorization.explain_authorization(
  document,
  current_user,
  :read
)
```

## Benefits of Implementation
Implementing this pattern would provide several benefits:

1. **Flexible Security Model**: Combine multiple authorization approaches for comprehensive security.
2. **Business Rule Integration**: Encode complex business rules directly into authorization policies.
3. **Contextual Decisions**: Make authorization decisions based on the full request context.
4. **Hierarchical Permissions**: Implement sophisticated role hierarchies and inheritance.
5. **Transparent Decisions**: Provide explanations for why authorization was granted or denied.
