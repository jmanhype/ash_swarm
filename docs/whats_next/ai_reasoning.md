# AI-Driven Business Reasoning

## Overview

This document outlines the current state and future direction of AI-driven reasoning capabilities within AshSwarm. These capabilities enable the automated design, generation, and orchestration of business processes, dramatically accelerating the development of AI-native business solutions.

## Core Concept

AshSwarm's AI reasoning capabilities leverage large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between business domain understanding and system implementation. By applying domain-driven design principles through AI, we enable:

1. **Business Process Automation**: Convert business rules into executable workflows
2. **Domain Model Generation**: Automatically create domain models from business requirements
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Design and implement complex business processes

## Current Implementation

### Domain Reasoning via Instructor

We've implemented initial AI reasoning capabilities using [Instructor](https://github.com/thmsmlr/instructor_ex), a structured prompting library for Elixir. This allows us to:

- Define Ecto schemas that represent business domain concepts
- Use LLMs to populate these schemas with domain-appropriate information
- Transform business rules into executable code

#### Example: Domain Model Extraction

```elixir
defmodule BusinessDomain do
  use Ecto.Schema
  use Instructor

  @llm_doc """
  A description of a business domain with entities and processes.
  """
  
  embedded_schema do
    field :domain_name, :string
    field :description, :string
    
    embeds_many :entities, Entity, primary_key: false do
      field :name, :string
      field :description, :string
      embeds_many :attributes, Attribute do
        field :name, :string
        field :type, Ecto.Enum, values: [:string, :integer, :boolean, :date, :float]
        field :description, :string
      end
    end
    
    embeds_many :processes, Process, primary_key: false do
      field :name, :string
      field :description, :string
      field :steps, {:array, :string}
    end
  end
end

# Extract domain model from business description
domain = Instructor.chat_completion(
  model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant", 
  response_model: BusinessDomain,
  messages: [
    %{
      role: "user", 
      content: "Create a domain model for an e-commerce checkout system"
    }
  ]
)
```

### Integration with Reactor

The extracted domain models and processes can be transformed into Reactor definitions:

1. Entities become Ash Resources
2. Processes become Reactors
3. Process steps become Reactor steps

This automated translation enables rapid development of business solutions that are:
- Aligned with business requirements
- Consistent with domain-driven design principles
- Executable within the Elixir ecosystem

## Upcoming Enhancements

### Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

- **Business Rule Extraction**: Automatically identify business rules from requirements documents
- **Decision Logic Generation**: Convert complex business rules into decision trees
- **Constraint Identification**: Identify and implement business constraints

### Automated System Design

- **End-to-End Solution Generation**: From business requirements to deployable code
- **Solution Templates**: Industry-specific templates for common business processes
- **Customization Suggestions**: AI-driven recommendations for extending base functionality

### Learning & Adaptation

- **Feedback Integration**: Learn from developer modifications to generated code
- **Domain Knowledge Base**: Build and refine domain-specific knowledge
- **Solution Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns in business solutions

## Business Impact

AI-driven reasoning fundamentally changes how business applications are built:

- **Time-to-Solution**: Reduce solution development time from months to days or hours
- **Business Alignment**: Ensure technology implementations match business requirements
- **Adaptability**: Quickly adjust to changing business needs
- **Knowledge Capture**: Encode business knowledge in executable systems

## Next Steps

Our immediate roadmap for AI reasoning includes:

1. **Library of Domain Models**: Create pre-defined models for common business domains
2. **Reasoning API**: Expose reasoning capabilities through a well-defined API
3. **Integration with Generators**: Combine reasoning with code generation tools
4. **Visual Reasoning**: Add visualization of the reasoning process

## Conclusion

AI-driven reasoning represents a paradigm shift in business application development. By leveraging LLMs to bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, AshSwarm enables the rapid development of sophisticated business solutions that are both technically sound and aligned with business needs.

The combination of Elixir's reliability, Ash's domain modeling capabilities, Reactor's workflow orchestration, and AI-driven reasoning creates a uniquely powerful platform for building the next generation of business applications.
