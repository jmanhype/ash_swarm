# Enhanced LLM Orchestration

This document details the planned enhancements to AshSwarm's LLM orchestration capabilities, moving from single-LLM calls to sophisticated multi-LLM coordination.

## Swarm Intelligence: Multi-LLM Consensus

### Overview

The Multi-LLM Consensus system will enable multiple LLMs to collaborate on complex reasoning tasks. Rather than relying on a single model's output, AshSwarm will coordinate multiple models to achieve more reliable and balanced results.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Task[Reasoning Task] --> Distributor[Task Distributor]
    Distributor --> LLM1[LLM Instance 1]
    Distributor --> LLM2[LLM Instance 2]
    Distributor --> LLM3[LLM Instance 3]
    Distributor --> LLMn[LLM Instance n]
    LLM1 --> Aggregator[Response Aggregator]
    LLM2 --> Aggregator
    LLM3 --> Aggregator
    LLMn --> Aggregator
    Aggregator --> Analysis[Consensus Analysis]
    Analysis --> Result[Final Result]
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Parallel Execution Framework**
   - Create a coordinator module that can distribute the same task to multiple LLMs
   - Implement asynchronous execution using Task for parallel processing
   - Integrate timeouts and failure handling

2. **Response Aggregation Strategies**
   - Majority voting for categorical decisions
   - Statistical aggregation for numerical estimates
   - Semantic similarity clustering for text responses
   - Custom aggregation logic for domain-specific tasks

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Develop a system to assess model confidence in responses
   - Weight model inputs based on confidence scores
   - Flag low-consensus items for human review

4. **Model Diversity Management**
   - Ensure diverse model selection (different architectures, training data)
   - Balance between model quality and resource consumption
   - Automatically adjust the number of models based on task complexity

## Adaptive Model Selection

### Overview

The Adaptive Model Selection system will intelligently choose the most appropriate LLM for a given task based on performance history, cost considerations, and task characteristics.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Task[Task Submission] --> Analyzer[Task Analyzer]
    Analyzer --> Features[Extract Task Features]
    Features --> Selector[Model Selector]
    
    ModelDB[(Model Performance DB)] --> Selector
    CostRules[(Cost Rules)] --> Selector
    
    Selector --> Selected[Selected Model]
    Selected --> Execution[Task Execution]
    Execution --> Tracker[Performance Tracker]
    Tracker --> ModelDB
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Task Characterization**
   - Develop metrics for task complexity

   - Create cost forecasting for model selection
   - Automate cost optimization based on usage patterns

## Fallback Chains

### Overview

Fallback Chains will enable graceful degradation of service by automatically trying alternative models when a preferred model fails or is unavailable.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Chain as Fallback Chain
    participant Primary as Primary Model
    participant Secondary as Secondary Model
    participant Fallback as Fallback Model
    
    App->>Chain: Execute task
    Chain->>Primary: Attempt with primary model
    
    alt Primary succeeds
        Primary-->>Chain: Return result
        Chain-->>App: Return result
    else Primary fails
        Primary-->>Chain: Error
        Chain->>Secondary: Attempt with secondary model
        
        alt Secondary succeeds
            Secondary-->>Chain: Return result
            Chain-->>App: Return result
        else Secondary fails
            Secondary-->>Chain: Error
            Chain->>Fallback: Attempt with fallback model
            Fallback-->>Chain: Return result
            Chain-->>App: Return result
        end
    end
```

4. **Dynamic Chain Adjustment**
   - Monitor success rates across the chain
   - Automatically reorder chain links based on reliability
   - Implement circuit breakers for consistently failing models

## Tool Use Orchestration

### Overview

Tool Use Orchestration will enable coordinated use of tools across multiple LLM interactions, allowing for complex multi-step processes with tool-augmented LLMs.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Tool Orchestrator"
        Coordinator[Tool Coordinator]
        Registry[Tool Registry]
        Permissions[Permission Manager]

    Coordinator --> LLM[LLM with Tool Calling]
    Registry --> Coordinator
    Permissions --> Coordinator
    
    LLM --> ToolCall[Tool Call Request]
