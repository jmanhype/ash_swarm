# What's Next for AshSwarm

This directory contains documents outlining the future roadmap and upcoming features for the AshSwarm project. These documents serve as a vision for where the project is headed and provide guidance for contributors who wish to help shape its future.

## Overview

The AshSwarm project is committed to continuous improvement and innovation. Our roadmap focuses on several key areas:

1. **Core System Enhancements** - Improvements to the fundamental architecture and capabilities of AshSwarm
2. **AI Integration** - Advanced LLM orchestration and interaction capabilities
3. **Developer Experience** - Tools and features to make development more productive and enjoyable
4. **Infrastructure** - Performance monitoring, scaling, and operational improvements
5. **Security & Compliance** - Features to ensure data protection and regulatory compliance
6. **Ecosystem Integration** - Better integration with the broader Elixir ecosystem and external systems

## Contribution Opportunities

Many of the features described in these documents present excellent opportunities for contribution. If you're interested in working on any of these features, please:

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/user/ash_swarm/issues) to see if there's already work being tracked
2. Discuss your ideas in the [Discussions](https://github.com/user/ash_swarm/discussions) section
3. Submit a proposal as a new issue, referencing the relevant feature document

## Roadmap Status

These roadmap documents are living documents that will evolve as the project progresses. Features may be added, modified, or reprioritized based on community feedback and project needs.

The current status of each feature can be tracked through our issue system. Features that have been implemented will be documented in the main project documentation and removed from these roadmap documents in future updates.

## Priorities and Timeline

Our current development priorities (as of the latest update) are:

1. **Core DSL Capabilities** - Enhancing the domain-specific language for creating swarms
2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Building robust testing tools for LLM-powered applications
3. **Developer Experience** - Creating intuitive tools for working with AshSwarm

While we don't maintain a strict timeline, we aim to deliver incremental improvements in each release, focusing on these priority areas first.
